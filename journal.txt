choosing parts
-Microcontroller requirements
	at least 4 PWM outputs and an additional 4 digital I/O 
	u(s)art to communicate with transciever
	opperating voltage is the same as transciever to minimize power circuitry (majority of 2.4GHz transcievers appear to be 3-3.3V)
	has free (or very inexpensive) compiler
	programming hardware is cheap or can be borrowed (usb -> serial converter) or already owned (usb)
	has large support community 
 
 atmega32u4/atmega16u4
	needs external crystal for programming/usb
	additional parts required:
		resistors
		capacitors
		usb connector
		16mhz crystal
	
	
-transciever
	2.4GHz band
	can communicate with selected microcontorllerr
		
	 	
 CYRF8935A-24LQXC
	additional parts required:
		inductor
		capacitors
		resistors
		12MHz crystal
		u.fl connector (for tuning)
		u.fl pigtail (for tuning)
		antenna (preferably printed - need to find pcb antenna design guide)

-power
	playstation controller dissassembled, space for cylindrical batteries in grips
	rechargable batteries
		lithium has best life cycle
	need charge circuitry
	usb charging (
