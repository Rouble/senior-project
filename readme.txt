Senior project to preplace a missing remote for an RC car from scratch.
Used a Playstation one controller to house controls (doubles as wireless USB game pad)

Code was written in C++ in Atmel studio 6.0 for the ATMega32u4 microcontoller to interface with 
the Cypress CYRF8935 2.4GHz transciever 

"H-bridge board" contains files related to the motor drive circuit board contained in the RC car
needed to wire in replacement reciver/control module

PCB design documents created with Altium Designer 13 Design folder contains PDFs of all designs
